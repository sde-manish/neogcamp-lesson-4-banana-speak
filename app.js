/*What is vanilla JavaScript?
Vanilla JavaScript refers to using plain Javascript without any additional
 libraries or frameworks. The term became popular when Eric Wastl created 
 the Vanilla JS site in 2012 as a joke. The site tries to bring attention 
 to the fact that you can use just plain Javascript in many cases.*/
